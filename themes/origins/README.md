# Dusk Theme for YouCan Shop

Dusk is a customizable starter theme designed for YouCan Shop. It acts as a starting point to help developers quickly create and customize themes using the YouCan CLI.

Dusk Theme is built using **liquid** templating language, **html**, **css** and **javascript** which makes it easy to customize. 



## Getting Started

### Using [YouCan CLI](https://github.com/youcan-shop/cli)

1. Install YouCan CLI and theme package:

```bash
npm install -g @youcan/cli@latest @youcan/theme@latest
```

2. Authorize the CLI:

```bash
youcan auth login
```

3. Initialize the starter theme:

```bash
youcan theme init
```

> YouCan CLI uploads this theme as a development version to the store you're connected to, ready for further modifications in your local code editor.

4. Start the Development Server:

```bash
youcan theme dev
```
